### [Air Quality Prediction System (Deployed)](https://04mscott.github.io/Air-Quality-App/)
+ Built and deployed an LSTM-based air quality prediction model using TensorFlow, trained on historical data and real-time updates from the OpenWeatherMap API.
  + **Test RMSE:** 0.1668, with a loss of 0.0292
  + **Web Interface:** Created an interactive Streamlit web app for users to view air quality predictions and trends.
  + **Automated Data Collection:** Integrated real-time API data and set up an automated pipeline for model updates via AWS.

### [Face Mask Image Classification Neural Network](https://04mscott.github.io/Face-Mask-Image-Classification/)
+ Constructed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow using a functional approach
  - Achieved a Test Accuracy of 0.9924 with a loss of 0.0306
  - Experimented with different hyperparameters and layers within the model
  - Constructed training, validation, and testing sets using file io functions using dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaykumar1799/face-mask-detection/data)
+ Implemented a GUI using TaiPy where users can upload an image and the model will make a prediction
