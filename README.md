## Projects

### [Image Classification Neural Network - Mask Wearing](https://04mscott.github.io/Mask-Detection/)
+ Constructed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow using a functional approach
  - Achieved a Test Accuracy of 0.9924 with a loss of 0.0306
  - Experimented with different hyperparameters and layers within the model
  - Constructed training, validation, and testing sets using file io functions using dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaykumar1799/face-mask-detection/data)
+ Implemented a GUI using TaiPy where users can upload an image and the model will make a prediction
